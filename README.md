DRAW 2 (which stands for **D**etect and **R**ecognize **A** **W**ide range of cards version 2) is an object detector
trained to detect _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ cards in all types of images, and in particular in dueling images.

This project is the OBS plugin part of the DRAW 2 system. It allows users to seamlessly integrate the
detector directly into their live streams or recorded videos; and those **without any particular technical skills**.
The plugin can display detected cards in real time for an enhanced viewing experience.
The python backend project is available [here](https://github.com/HichTala/draw2).

### 🛠️ Installation

Follow the installation instruction depending on your operating system so everything works smoothly:

<details open>
<summary>🪟 Windows</summary>

1. Download the plugin installer from this
   link: [DRAW2 OBS Plugin Installer](https://github.com/HichTala/draw2-obsplugin/releases/download/0.1.0/draw2-obs-plugin-installer.exe)
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Once the installation is complete, launch OBS Studio. If everything is set up correctly, you should see in the
   `Docks` menu
   a new option called `Draw 2`. You can activate the dock and dock it wherever you want.
4. At this step the installation is not complete yet. You need to download the DRAW 2 model weights.
   Close OBS Studio and open the folder where the plugin is installerd. By default, it should be in:
   `C:\Program Files\draw2`. Here you can open the `python` folder right click anywhere and select `Open in Terminal`.
5. In the terminal, run the following command to download the model weights:
   ```bash
   ./python.exe -c "import draw;draw.run()"
   ```
6. At this step you should see some logs including progress bars downloading the model weights.
   Once you see
    ```bash
    Running Draw2 without OBS shared memory
    Waiting for OBS to start...
   ```
   the download is complete, you can relaunch OBS Studio.

<summary>🐧 Linux</summary>

Coming soon 👀

<summary>🍏 MacOS</summary>

I'm not familiar enough with OBS on macOS to provide a reliable installation guide.
The plugin is able to compile successfully on macOS, but I haven't tested it thoroughly.
If you have experience with OBS plugins on macOS and would like to contribute an installation guide,
please feel free to submit a pull request.

### 🚀 Usage

When the plugin is installed and the model weights are downloaded, you can launch OBS Studio.

1. Open the `Docks` menu and select `Draw 2` to activate the plugin dock.
2. In the Draw 2 dock, you can configure the plugin settings by clicking on the gear icon next to `Start DRAW` button:
    - **Select Deck List**: Choose the deck list file that contains the cards you want to detect. 3 deck lists
      can be handled at the same time. To add new deck lists, you can click the `Open Folder` button and drag and drop
      your deck list files (in ydk format) into the opened folder.
    - **Minimum Out of Screen Time**: The minimum time a card just detected can be displayed again.
    - **Minimum Screen Time**: The minimum time a card is displayed.
    - **Confidence Threshold**: Set the minimum confidence level for card detection. Detections below this threshold
      will be ignored.
3. The plugin provide a new source called `Draw Display`. You can add it to your scene like any other source.
   This source will display the detected cards on the screen. You can choose what source/scene to detect cards from.
4. Click the `Start DRAW` button to start the detection process. The plugin will start detecting cards in real time
   and display them on the screen using the `Draw Display` source. The plugin start detecting from the moment you see
   the
   `Stop DRAW` button. If you don't see it something went wrong.
5. In the other case you can enjoy the plugin!
